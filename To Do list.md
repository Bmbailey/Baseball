This is a To Do list:

* Copyright idea

  * Finalize title
  * Begin searching/ finding someone to design logo [Tyler Fleming](http://www.tflem.com) ?
  * Purchase domain, figure out website design. Determine who will maintain website.
  * Possibly purchase other domains to redirect in case of user error

* Establish Diagram Films as parent company?

  * If that does end up being the case, I still need to re-establish the domain for [Diagram](www.diagramfilms.com) and create a new site under my own management. It's cheaper this way in the long run. I think.
  * Ask Nick's opinion haha.

* Establish Core crew

  * Accounting dept? Can we do within? Do we hire outside?
  * Social Media strategist? Marketing?

* Update core crew on plan, request feedback and plan accordingly

  * Begin planning for gear needs
  * start planning how/where to share info with everyone electronically
  * Create NDA for crew

* Decide where to seek sources for each location, establish sources

  * Find food distinct to that city or region, when possible. (e.g. [Slingers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slinger))
  * Find bars: local beer, local booze, e.g., [Malort](http://www.jeppsonsmalort.com/jm.html) See [Malort's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7s16ewP1RU) own unaired commercial for more info.

* Research distribution opportunities and possible conflicts with each one. Will there be any conflicts with potential sponsors and potential distort routes?
