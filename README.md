## Setup
If you’ve never used Github before (and lets face it, most video people probably haven’t) it might seem a little odd to be using this for managing the project. It’s actually a pretty awesome collaboration and project management platform, and below, I’m going to walk you through getting set up so that you can begin working on the project with us.

### Create a Github Account
This is a fairly straightforward test. Please don’t fail it.

### Request Access
Next, you'll open a new issue on [this repository](http://github.com/bmbailey/Baseball) asking to be made a collaborator.

### Download Github Desktop and Atom
One of the great things about Git is that you can work offline. The not great thing about Git is that it requires the use of the Terminal, which scares anyone who isn't [l33t](http://static.trackback.it/625X0/www/trackback/it/img/l33t-haxor.jpg).

Because GitHub is awesome, they solved this problem by creating a really cool application that handles the installation of Git and the management of projects (they're called "repositories" on GitHub).

As if that wasn't cool enough, they also make a text editor that @bmbailey and I highly reccomend you use called Atom.

You'll want to download both [GitHub Desktop](http://desktop.github.com) and [Atom](http://atom.io) just to make your life easy. Trust us.
